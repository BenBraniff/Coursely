Setting up my own database with railway since The one we used before was run on Mina's account. I want my own so I can have my own version.

(1)
Create your own Railway Database
Log into Railway.app with your GitHub account.

Click + New Project -> Provision PostgreSQL.

Once the database is created, click on it and go to the Connect tab.

Copy the PostgreSQL Connection URL. It will look something like: postgresql://postgres:password@your-host.railway.app:5432/railway

(2)
Look for a .env file: If you have one, update the DATABASE_URL there.


(3)
run moodle_db which will install database into railway
python3 moodle_db.py




Configure Railway Environment Variables
Even though you have a .env file locally, you should not push your .env to GitHub (for security). Instead, you must tell Railway what those values are:

Go to your Railway Dashboard.

Select your Flask Service.

Click the Variables tab.

Add these variables manually:

DATABASE_URL: (Your postgres connection string)

SECRET_KEY: (A random string for your JWT tokens)

PYTHONUNBUFFERED: 1 (Helps with logging)
